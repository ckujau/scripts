# This program just modifies the value of backlight keyboard for Apple Laptops
# You must run it as root user or via sudo.
# As a shortcut you could allow to admin users to run via sudo without password
# prompt. To do this you must add sudoers file the next contents:
#
#  Cmnd_Alias CMDS = /usr/local/bin/keyboard-backlight.sh
#  %admin ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: CMDS
#
# After this you can use this script as follows:
#
#     Increase backlight keyboard:
#	    $ sudo keyboard-backlight.sh up
#     Decrease backlight keyboard:
#	    $ sudo keyboard-backlight.sh down
#     Increase to total value backlight keyboard:
#	    $ sudo keyboard-backlight.sh total
#     Turn off backlight keyboard:
#	    $ sudo keyboard-backlight.sh off
#
# You can customize the amount of backlight by step by changing the INCREMENT
# variable as you want it.
